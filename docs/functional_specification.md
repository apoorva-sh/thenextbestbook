# Functional Specification

## Background

Finding new books to read isn’t always easy. Looking at the size of libraries and some bookstores, it’s hardly surprising that there’s a lot of bad stuff circulating as well. Until recently, we limited ourselves to word of mouth and the tedious business of reading the back of every book on the shelves. How old-fashioned.

With the help of statistical techniques and large scale data processing we plan to build a book recommendation engine, that aims to serve to all book-lovers alike. No need to register or sign-up. Just enter the name of the book/author you have last read, and we shall provide you with 'quick' recommendations that will help you select your next favourite book.

## User profile

- Who uses the system.

Any person who is interested in finding new books to read or is just exploring the many books found on the shelves, thenextbestbook is an online platform where users can explore books and receive recommendations based on their preferences.

- What they know about the domain and computing (e.g., can browse the web, can program in Python)

The user is expected to know how to browse the web. The recommendation engine will be deployed on the web, and any user with access to the internet will be access it. Knowledge of previous books read would be useful in generating better recommendations.
