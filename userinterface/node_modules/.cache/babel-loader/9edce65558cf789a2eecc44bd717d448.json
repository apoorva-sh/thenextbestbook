And sometimes making ends meet requires her to investigate a little royal wrongdoing.\\nWhile my beau Darcy is off on a mysterious mission, I am once again caught between my high birth and empty purse. I am therefore relieved to receive a new assignment from the Queen--especially one that includes lodging. The King's youngest son, George, is to wed Princess Marina of Greece, and I shall be her companion at the supposedly haunted Kensington Palace.\\nMy duties are simple: help Marina acclimate to English life, show her the best of London and, above all, dispel any rumors about George's libertine history. Perhaps that last bit isn't so simple.\\nGeorge is known for his many affairs with women as well as men--including the great songwriter Noel Coward. But things truly get complicated when I search the Palace for a supposed ghost only to encounter an actual dead person: a society beauty said to have been one of Prince George's mistresses.\\nNothing spoils a royal wedding more than murder, and the Queen wants the whole matter hushed. But as the investigation unfolds--and Darcy, as always, turns up in the most unlikely of places--the investigation brings us precariously close to the prince himself.\",\n        \"isbn\": \"\",\n

Her native land is now unfamiliar, recast in shadow by her one good eye, her damaged psyche, and her weakened body. Arriving in the rain-soaked small town in Washington state that Marci had called home, she makes a troubling discovery: Marci's eight-year-old daughter has vanished. When a stray dog--a powerful, dark, unreadable creature, no one's idea of a pet--seems to adopt LeAnne, a surprising connection is formed and something shifts inside her. As she becomes obsessed with finding Marci's daughter, LeAnne and her inscrutable canine companion are drawn into danger as dark and menacing as her last Afghan mission.
